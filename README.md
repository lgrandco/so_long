`make map` to get a random map with default values that can be modified in the Makefile

`./map.sh x y wall_density item_density` to get a random map, max (x,y) would be (120x67 for fullHD screen and 16x16 imgs), recommended item_density is 1/10*y and wall_desnity is 2*item_density

`./so_long maps/{map name}` to run with whatever map you want
